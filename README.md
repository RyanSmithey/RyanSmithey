- Hi, I’m @RyanSmithey
- I’m interested in Game Design
- I’m currently learning networking and dedicated servers for cross platform mobile and PC
- How to reach me RSmithey42@gmail.com

Over the past 2-3 years I have continously worked on improving my knowledge about the systems used to create games.
This containes various unity projects including procedural terrain, voxel systems, octree based space partitioning, ray-tracing using HLSL code, and networking meshing both azure playfab database, Unity mirror, and Amazon Web Services to create and run a dedicated game server. These projects span several versions of Unity, however the projects are mostly compatible between versions as most is custom implemented code.
These projects are available on this github account. As I continue to learn I will update this site with more projects.
